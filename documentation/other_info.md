## Flag Bytes

Though only two are required by the LLAP specification, in imitation of the Macintosh's behavior, TashTalk precedes all
transmissions with three flag bytes.  This is known to be a requirement for communication with the Apple IIgs.

TashTalk only needs to receive one flag byte in the preamble of a frame but will tolerate any number of them.
